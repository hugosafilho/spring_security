Spring Security example without the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

I have provided a Shell Script, executeVault.sh, in the scripts directory to execute the application after running 'mvn -Dmaven.test.skip clean package.'

The script exports the variables 'vaultFile' and 'vaultFile.' Both files are required by the application.
